My progect allows you to render simple api tests(requests) using Reqres simulates real application scenarios and axios library.
In additional here are two tests as example: one functional and one is ui test. For functional and ui test cases I was using: yarn as a package manager for my code, that allows me to use and share (e.g. JavaScript) code with others, cypress as a testing framework to run my tests. 

Enjoy!
